## To Install into Slack 
- Navigate to https://api.slack.com/ select "Start Building"
- Name your App `osTicket Notification`, select your Workspace from the drop-down
- Select "Incoming Webhooks"
- Activate the Webhooks with the link (it defaults to Off, just click Off to change it to On)

The channel you select will receive an event notice, like:

```
You should also receive an email from Slack telling you about the new Integration.

## Test!
Create a ticket!

You should see something like the following appear in your Slack channel:

When a user replies, you'll get something like:

![slack-reply](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5077391/31572648-9279eb18-b0f6-11e7-97da-9a9c63a200d4.png)

Notes, Replies from Agents and System messages shouldn't appear, usernames are links to the user's page 
in osTicket, the Ticket subject is a link to the ticket, as is the ticket ID.

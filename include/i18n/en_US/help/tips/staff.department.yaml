survey_closed_tickets:
    title: Enable Lime Survey Module for this Department
    content: >
        If enabled, this will allow you to configure the survey settings for this department.<br/>
        You will need to make sure you setup a TicketID question and a Staff Name question
        under a question group on your Lime Survey server.<br/>
        <strong>Make sure each question is hidden on your survey otherwise customers who click
        the survey link will be able to see and change the Ticket ID and Staff Name for the ticket
        that the survey relates to.</strong><br/><br/>
        I would reccomend setting up the TicketID and StaffID questions under the first question
        group you create in your Lime Survey server.<br/>

        <strong>Publication &amp; access control</strong> section of your survey options.

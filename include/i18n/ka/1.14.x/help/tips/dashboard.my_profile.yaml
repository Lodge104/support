    Create an optional <span class="doc-desc-title">Signature</span> that perhaps appears at the end of your Ticket Responses. Whether this <span class="doc-desc-title">Signature</span> appears, or not, depends on the <span class="doc-desc-title">Email Template</span> that will be used in a Ticket Response.
